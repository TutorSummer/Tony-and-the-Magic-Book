// script.js (No JavaScript is strictly needed beyond the inline `onclick` for this simple flip)
// However, if you wanted to manage cards dynamically or add more complex features,
// you would add JS here. For this basic example, the HTML's inline onclick is sufficient.

// If you were to add more complex JS, you might do something like this:
/*
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const flashcards = document.querySelectorAll('.flashcard');

    flashcards.forEach(card => {
        card.addEventListener('click', () => {
            card.classList.toggle('flipped');
        });
    });
});
*/
